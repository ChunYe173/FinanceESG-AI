# AI ESG Monitoring and Fraud Prevention in Trade Finance Challenge

## Introduction

In today's world, where sustainability and responsible business practices are paramount, the "AI ESG Monitoring and Fraud Prevention in Trade Finance Challenge" emerges as a crucial initiative. The goal is to revolutionize ESG monitoring, trade finance digitization, and fraud prevention using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This project addresses the pressing need for more inclusive and accurate assessments of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and tackles the issue of misleading "green" claims (greenwashing).

## Problem Statement

This project aims to enhance the assessment of SME sustainability, uncover misleading "green" claims, and ensure safer trade practices. This project promises to demonstrate better decision-making, increase corporate honesty, and safer trade processes. The ultimate goal is to craft an AI-driven solution that brings transformative changes in three main areas:

1. **ESG Monitoring**: Provide a holistic evaluation of companies by measuring their ESG factors and addressing the lack of data for smaller entities.
2. **Greenwashing Detection**: Develop a model with 85% accuracy to identify deceptive sustainability claims.
3. **Digital Identity Scoring**: Create a robust AI model for learning and scoring the digital identity of SMEs.

## Approach & Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Collection**: Identify and integrate new data sources.
2. **Aggregate Data & Assign ESG Scores**: Implement AI to process diverse datasets and create algorithms for assigning ESG scores.
3. **Combat Greenwashing**: Develop an AI model with ~85% accuracy to distinguish genuine sustainability claims from deceptive ones.
4. **Extract Financial & Sustainability Metrics**: Apply NLP to derive actionable insights from text data, processing and categorizing data points.
5. **User-Friendly UI**: Develop a dashboard to display the ESG Scores, Greenwashing Probability, Sustainability Metrics of each company extracted by AI models.
